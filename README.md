An Apple 2 Emulator started in 1993, found in 2023.

The initial checkin is the code as it was found on an old CD I made at a place
I used to work.  This was a personal project I did to learn more about assembly
language, and it was fascinating.

This is version about 0.3.  There was a later version, apparently lost to the
mists of time, where all the 6502 opcodes were implemented.  Will have to redo
work to get back there, if I care enough.

The original version compiled under Visual Studio 1.5 for 16-bit, and MSVC 2.0
for 32-bit and MacOS 7, using the MSVC Cross-Compiler for Mac.  That product
is long unavailable and I do not expect to be able to compilie it for Mac
again, at least not with MSVC directly.

This initial checkin includes the original file structure and file names;
those will be updated as the code is moved forward to a modern system.
