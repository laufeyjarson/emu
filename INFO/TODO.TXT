TODO.TXT

This is a list of things that are left to be done, and thier addidion and
completion dates.  Dates are now added, because I'm curious.

3-1-95	Started to-do list.  Will be complete when the project is.

3-1-95	Mac platform bug: Memory Windows appear much too wide, and then sizing
		is awkward at best,  NC_CALCSIZE apparently isn't quite there.
		A possible soloution is to call MoveWindow with better sizing
		before we make it visible.

3-1-95	Got the needed stuff for the Video started,  To do video right, we'll
		need an Apple // Font that gets loaded at startup, and that's a lot
		of work.  I don't even know how to make one.  The old Win 3.0 SDK
		shipped with a Bitmap Font Editor, and I'd be happy with that.

3-1-95	Text mode should get in soon.  Should I create a window for each
		possible mode, then only show the correct windows at any one given
		time?  Thusly, the Hires, Lores, and text screens would all exist
		all the time?  Or should I try and create the screen at video switch
		time?  Video switch is going to be too slow anyhow; better make them
		all at screen startup time.

		Text1	- 40x24
		Text2	- 40x24
		Text3	- 40x24
		Hires1	- hgr, sizing to show all or part,
		Hires2	- hgr
		Lores1	- hgr
		Lores2	- hgr

		Default to Text1
		Fill screens to 0's at boot.

		Graphics has a nasty interleave; you don't think that my neat little
		functions will work for all of the modes, do you?  The interleave
		looks a lot alike; change the 40's and 3's and things...  hires will
		have to wait a little while,  I can get text going, though.
		For now, use the System Fixed Width Font...

3-2-95	Got text and lores mostly in.  They don't refresh on load or save, and they
		don't have the correct colors, but other than that they look pretty good.
