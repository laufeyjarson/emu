Known bugs:

Help is not at all even started.
There is no keyboard equivalent to the Memory Window; you MUST use the mouse.
There is no dissasembler.
There is no assembler.
26 (of 56) instructions are not working yet.

I got 30 instructions in and tested in one solid day's work.  The hardest part
of that was the memory addressing translation table (see decode.txt and the
GetSetVal function in e6502.c) (moved to einstr.c)

ADC (Add with Carry) and SBC (SuBtract wuth Carry) are worrying me, as they
are hard.  I finally figured out the overflow bit, and now may try writing
code.  It has to suport BCD!  Eek!  I've never done BCD.

The Window Memory Chain is in place for the CPU's use.  The cached part of
it can show a bug, however.  If the start or end is outside the view area
of a window, that window dosen't get updated.  With the CPU only able to
update one byte at a time, this is never a problem.  The Memory Windows can
get a little strange if load or data entry is done.

RESOLVED ISSUES:

I've got to add an hourglass or "Loading..." or "Saving..." message, as
saving hangs Windows pretty well.  It is worse under 16-bit.  NT handles
things better.  This is now fixed, with a cool custom spinner cursor.
