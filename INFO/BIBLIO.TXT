I used these reference books along the way.  Each of them was useful in some
way, or contributed.  I likely consulted many many more.

"6502 Assembly Language Programming"
by Lance A. Leventhal.  
(C) 1979 Osbore/McGraw-Hill,
ISBN 0-931988-27-6
References: chapter 3, on the specifics of the 6502 and it's memory addressing
modes.

"Tips Tricks and Techniques/6502 Instructions"
Compiled by Beagle Bros. Software Inc.
Chart.#1, included with Double-Take software.
(C) 1983
References: The whole back page; a handy and complete guide to 6502
instructions, in an easier to swallow form than Leventhal.  Less complete,
as it is a quick-reference table.
